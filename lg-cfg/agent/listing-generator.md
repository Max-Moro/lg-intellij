# Context Window Content

The primary content of your context window is prepared by **Listing Generator** — a software tool for assembling "dense" contexts from source code in the repository. This tool should already be configured to immediately provide you with all the necessary data to complete the assigned task. Typically, this means you don't need to independently investigate the codebase through reading and search tools: Read, Edit, Glob, Grep, and so on.

If, after initial analysis, you understand that you clearly lack data for quality task execution:

- not all useful project documentation is loaded into the context;
- not all code related to the task is immediately visible (based on import analysis);
- the overall project architecture is unclear;
- the context is prepared for a different functional block and was sent to you by mistake;

, then in such a situation, you should immediately stop working on the task and notify the user about a problem with the **Listing Generator** tool.
